Yes! You can automate Philippine payroll salary computations using government-mandated formulas for deductions like SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, and withholding tax. Here's a breakdown of where to get each and how to compute them for 2025:

âœ… 1. SSS (Social Security System)
Resource: SSS Contribution Table 2025
As of the 2024 table (unless updated in mid-2025), here's the general formula:

Contribution Rate: 14% of the monthly salary credit (MSC), with a cap at â‚±30,000.

Employer: 9.5%

Employee: 4.5%

ðŸ“Œ Example for â‚±24,000 salary:

MSC: â‚±24,000

Total Contribution = â‚±3,360

Employee share = â‚±1,080

Employer share = â‚±2,280

âœ… 2. PhilHealth
Resource: PhilHealth Circulars
As of 2025:

Rate: 5% of monthly salary (split 50/50 by employer and employee)

Salary floor: â‚±10,000 | Ceiling: â‚±100,000

ðŸ“Œ â‚±24,000 salary:

5% of â‚±24,000 = â‚±1,200

Employee share = â‚±600

Employer share = â‚±600

âœ… 3. Pag-IBIG
Resource: Pag-IBIG Official Site

Standard contribution: 2% of monthly salary

Capped at â‚±5,000 (for most employers unless opted higher)

Employee share: 2% (â‚±100 max)

Employer share: 2% (â‚±100 max)

ðŸ“Œ â‚±24,000 salary:

Employee share = â‚±100

Employer share = â‚±100

âœ… 4. Withholding Tax (Based on TRAIN Law)
Use BIR Revised Withholding Tax Table (Updated for 2023+, still applicable in 2025 unless announced otherwise)

Taxable Income = Gross - SSS - PhilHealth - Pag-IBIG

ðŸ“Œ Example Computation:

Gross Salary = â‚±24,000

Total Deductions:

SSS: â‚±1,080

PhilHealth: â‚±600

Pag-IBIG: â‚±100

Taxable Income = â‚±22,220

Youâ€™ll now use the BIR Monthly Withholding Tax Table to compute tax on â‚±22,220.
